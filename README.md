# Crystal Collector Game

In this App four crystals will be displayed on the webpage with each being assigned a hidden random number. At the start of each game the user will be shown a random number that will try to reach by clicking on each of the crystal displayed. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. The user will win the game if the total score matches the random number that is shown at the start of the game and loses if the total score exceeds this random number.
